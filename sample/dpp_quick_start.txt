DPP format Quick Start Guide:

    Please see README.md for a full documentation.

    Items below described DPP functionality but it is true for iTunes format just see hepl for format to obtain whole
    set of command line options.

1. Install external tools needed for conversion:

    1.1 JDK-8 must be used. JAVA_HOME must be set and 'java' must be in the PATH. 

    1.2 Get FFMPEG (https://ffmpeg.org/)

    1.3. Get x264 Encoder (http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html).
         10-bit version must be used!

    1.4. Get BMX: bmx2raw and raw2bmx applications from tools/bmx directory that contains proper BMX snapshots
    (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmxlib/).

    1.5. Get ASDCP tool. Please build it from https://github.com/DSRCorporation/asdcplib-as02 repository.
         This is a fork from from http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/ which is enhanced to work properly with TTML wrapped in MXF.
         There is a Windows distribution there which can be used out of the box on Windows (TBD).

2. Download the source code of IMF Conversion Utility.

3. Build the source code (JDK-8 must be used!):
    ./gradlew clean build

4. Go to /build directory to find a distribution.

5. Extract the distribution and go to 'imf-conversion-utility-1.0.0' folder.

6. [Optional] Edit sample/config.xml if needed. It can be used as is, if all external tools installed at step 1 are added to the PATH.
   Please see README for a full description of config.xml.

7. Edit sample/dpp_metadata.xml if needed (either enter correct duration for PartDuration and TotalProgrammeDuration fields, or use 00:00:00:00).
   Please note that all timestamps are in SMPTE timecode format (hh:mm:ss:ff), where ff is in range [0,24] for 25 fps.
   Please see README for a full description of metadata.xml.
   A sample metadata.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m metadata -o metadata.xml

8. [Optional] Edit sample/dpp_audiomap.xml if needed.
   Please see README for a full description of audiomap.xml.
   A sample audiomap.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m audiomap -o audiomap.xml
     
9. Run conversion by executing the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/dpp_metadata.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   if audiomap must be used, then run

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/dpp_metadata.xml --audiomap sample/dpp_audiomap.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   Please note, than -w, --imp and --cpl values can be set in config.xml instead.
    
10. An output flat files are created under the specified -w directory and called '{output-dir}/{outputName}.mxf' and '{output-dir}/{outputName}.stl'.

11. Logs:
    10.1 The current conversion job log file: /logs/imf-utility.log.
    10.2 Previous conversion jobs log files: /logs/archive.
    10.3 External tools log files: {output-dir}/logs.
