Quick Start Guide for MAC OS X.

    Please see README.md for a full documentation.

1. Run install.sh script to install all external tools needed for conversion.
   The script does the following:
        1.1 Installs brew and uses it for installation of some tools.
        1.2 Uses brew to install Java (JDK-8).
        1.3 Uses brew to install FFMPEG.
        1.4 Uses brew to install x264 (10 bit).
        1.5 Uses brew to install uriparser (needed for bmx).
        1.6 Uses brew to install openssl (needed for as-02-unwrap).
        1.7 Copies pre-build BMX (raw2bmx and mxf2raw) and as-02-unwrap with required libraries to /usr/local/bin and /use/local/lib
            (so, they will be added to the PATH automatically).

2. Extract the distribution (imf-conversion-utility-1.0.0.tar.gz) to some place.

3. Go to 'imf-conversion-utility-1.0.0' folder.
   
4. [Optional] Edit sample/config.xml if needed. It can be used as is, if all external tools are installed successfully at step 1.
   Please see README for a full description of config.xml.

5. Edit sample/metadata.xml if needed (either enter correct duration for PartDuration and TotalProgrammeDuration fields, or use 00:00:00:00).
   Please note that all timestamps are in SMPTE timecode format (hh:mm:ss:ff), where ff is in range [0,24] for 25 fps.
   Please see README for a full description of metadata.xml.
   A sample metadata.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m metadata -o metadata.xml

6. [Optional] Edit sample/audiomap.xml if needed.
   Please see README for a full description of audiomap.xml.
   A sample audiomap.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m audiomap -o audiomap.xml

7. Run conversion by executing the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/metadata.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   if audiomap must be used, then run

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/metadata.xml --audiomap sample/audiomap.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   Please note, than -w, --imp and --cpl values can be set in config.xml instead.

8. An output flat files are created under the specified -w directory and called '{output-dir}/{outputName}.mxf' and '{output-dir}/{outputName}.stl'.

9. Logs:
    10.1 The current conversion job log file: /logs/imf-utility.log.
    10.2 Previous conversion jobs log files: /logs/archive.
    10.3 External tools log files: {output-dir}/logs.
